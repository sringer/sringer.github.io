##Hello All!

Seeing as this is my first post, I'd just like to give a little overview of what the plan is going forward with this blog. 
For the most part this will be covering various programming topics and projects I'm working on. I have several ideas I've been working on in my spare time, and the goal is to have them at a robust-ish state sometime before the end of the year. By then, hopefully, they will have made it past my oft overly high expectation barrier and become open source.

Feel free to ask any questions you have of me at anytime, via the comment system that I have yet to implement - or through the usual email and social network jazz that makes up roughly *ALL* of the internet nowadays.

Thank you, and goodnight.
